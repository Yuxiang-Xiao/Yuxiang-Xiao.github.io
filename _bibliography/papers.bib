    abstract = "Zero-shot event detection is a challenging task. Recent research work proposed to use a pre-trained textual entailment (TE) model on this task. However, those methods treated the TE model as a frozen annotator. We treat the TE model as an annotator that can be enhanced. We propose to use TE models to annotate large-scale unlabeled text and use annotated data to finetune the TE model, yielding an improved TE model. Finally, the improved TE model is used for inference on the test set. To improve the efficiency, we propose to use keywords to filter out sentences with a low probability of expressing event(s). To improve the coverage of keywords, we expand limited number of seed keywords using WordNet, so that we can use the TE model to annotate unlabeled text efficiently. The experimental results show that our method can outperform other baselines by 15{\%} on the ACE05 dataset.",
