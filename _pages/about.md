Iâ€™m currently a Master Student of Robotics at the National University of Singapore. My research interests are End2End Autonomous Driving with a focus on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning.

These days I have the opportunity to conduct research on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Vehicles in the [Multi-Agent Robotic Motion (MARMot) Laboratory](https://www.marmotlab.org/) advised by [Asst. Prof. Guillaume Sartoretti](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/sartoretti-guillaume-a/).

In July 2024, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Robotic Engineering from the South China University of Technology. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research in Natural Language Processing and LLMs, specifically in Zero-shot Learning and Event Detection, under the supervision of [Prof. Ziqian Zeng](https://ziqianzeng.github.io/).

<span style="color: #ff66b2;">I am looking for 26's Ph.D opportunities and Research Internship.</span>
