Iâ€™m Yuxiang Xiao, currently pursuing my Master of Robotics @ NUS. 
I am looking for 26's Ph.D opportunities and Research Internship.
My research focuses on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Vehicles in the MARMot lab @NUS. 
During my undergraduate studies in Robotic Engineering @ SCUT, I conducted research in Natural Language Processing and LLMs, specifically in Zero-shot Learning and Event Detection, under the supervision of Prof. Ziqian Zeng.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
