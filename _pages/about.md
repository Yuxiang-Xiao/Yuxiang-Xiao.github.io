<h2>Hi! I'm Yuxiang Xiao</h2>

<p>Iâ€™m currently a Master Student of Robotics at the <strong>National University of Singapore</strong>. My research interests are End2End Autonomous Driving with a focus on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning.</p>

<p>These days I have the opportunity to conduct research on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Vehicles in the <a href="https://www.marmotlab.org/">Multi-Agent Robotic Motion (MARMot) Laboratory</a> advised by <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/sartoretti-guillaume-a/">Asst. Prof. Guillaume Sartoretti</a>.</p>

<p>In July 2024, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Robotic Engineering from the <strong>South China University of Technology</strong>. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research in Natural Language Processing and LLMs, specifically in Zero-shot Learning and Event Detection, under the supervision of <a href="https://ziqianzeng.github.io/">Prof. Ziqian Zeng</a>.</p>

<p><span style="color: #a41034;">I am looking for 26's Ph.D opportunities and Research Internship.</span></p>
