Iâ€™m Yuxiang Xiao, currently pursuing my Master of Robotics @ NUS.

My research focuses on Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Vehicles in the MARMot lab @NUS.

During my undergraduate studies in Robotic Engineering @ SCUT, I conducted research in Natural Language Processing and LLMs, specifically in Zero-shot Learning and Event Detection, under the supervision of Prof. Ziqian Zeng.

**I am looking for 26's Ph.D opportunities and Research Internship.**
